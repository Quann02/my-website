          I’m Phu Quan, a fourth-year student at the University of Washington, majoring in Informatics with a minor in Data Science. 
          My background combines strong technical skills in web development, cybersecurity, and data analytics, 
          with experience in Python, JavaScript, R, and Postgres. I’ve completed coursework and real-world 
          projects, including a web API server project and a cybersecurity research project on firewalls at Carnegie Mellon University. 
          Outside of academics, I bring hands-on experience as a Database Assistant and a consultative approach, 
          aiming to drive value through both technical contributions and strategic thinking.
